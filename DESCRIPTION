Description: Tools for undertaking budget impact analyses for
    mental health projects.  This development version of the bimp package
    has been made available as part of the process of testing and
    documenting the package. The tools contained in this development
    release automate a number of tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY
    STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore you should only trial this
    software if you feel confident that you understand what it does and
    have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing.
    If you have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The documentation for this package
    has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is
    therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored documentation will follow
    in 2021.
