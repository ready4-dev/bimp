Description: Tools for undertaking budget impact analyses for mental
    health projects.  This development version of the bimp package has
    been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting
    the package. The tools contained in this development release automate
    a number of tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL
    MACHINE.  Therefore you should only trial this software if you feel
    confident that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit
    area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any
    questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The documentation for this package
    has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is
    therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored documentation will follow
    in 2021.
