  This development version of the bimp package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. The tools contained in this development release automate a number of tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.
  Therefore you should only trial this software if you feel confident that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
  The documentation for this package has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored documentation will follow in 2021.",
